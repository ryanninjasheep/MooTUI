LISTBOX NOTES
	Let's approach this from two perspectives.  First, what interaction behavior does a user expect from this control;
	then, what does a programmer expect to be able to do with it?

	User:
	 - Definite:
	    - Select a certain item [x]
	    - User up/down arrow keys to move selection [x]
		- If there are more items than can fit, scroll to see all of them [x]
	 - Possible:
		- Highlight hovered item [x]
	    - Select multiple items by holding shift [ ]
		   - Discontinuous?
	    - Drag items to move [ ]
		   - Within ListBox [ ]
		   - Between controls [ ]
	Programmer:
	 - Definite:
	    - Know what item is selected [x]
		   - Know when selection is changed [x]
		- Add and remove items [x]
		   - Ensure selected item is the same, unless it is removed [ ]
	 - Possible:
		- Reorder items [ ]
	    - Multiple Selection [ ]
		- Change visual behavior [x]
