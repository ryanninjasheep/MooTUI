Short-Term:

Long-Term:
 - Add more controls
    - Grid (will be difficult!!!)
    - Radio Button
       -> actually, "radio group" makes more sense
    - Slider
       -> needs drag support!
    - NumberBox - there's a better name
    - ProgressBar
    - Terminal?
    - Modal
       - DropdownMenu
    - TreeView
    - TabWindow?
    - Expander
       - Accordion
 - Work on size changes
 - Outline label acts as button?
 - Mouse drag to select in any selectable span
 - Animation support?  Particle support?
 - More involved info panel
    - Debug Mode
 - Perhaps separate mouseDown and mouseUp to allow for dragging
    - When something is clicked, it receives the mouseUp signal even if the mouse has moved away!
