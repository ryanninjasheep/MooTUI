MOOTUI CORE

MooTUI Core provides the lowest-level interaction with WPF and other forms of input.  While IO and
Widgets contain a specific implementation of a particular UI paradigm, Core can be reused in completely
different circumstances.

MooViewer can be used to display any Visual.  It also provides InputEventArgs (and translates mouse and keyboard
input as appropriate) if user interaction is desired.
